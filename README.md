Low-Frequency Unsupervised Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring for Industrial Loads
============================

> Repo of the code and documentation related to my master's degree dissertation in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Coimbra.

> The dissertation titled "Low-Frequency Unsupervised Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring for Industrial Loads" focuses on developing innovative techniques for monitoring industrial loads.

> Code developed in MATLAB, Python and C++, and techniques include numerical and metaheuristic algorithms for nonlinear constrained optimization.
