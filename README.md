 Structure:
- documentation: documentation of my dissertation.
- imdeld_dataset (in .gitignore): the original csv files from the IMDELD dataset.
- imdeld_analysis: code for the analysis of the IMDELD dataset, writen in MATLAB and result for the code.
- optimization_algorithms: code that implements the the algorithm for global non-convex constraint optimization.

How to install and set up:
- clone the repo.
- create a folder inside the repo called imdeld_dataset.
- download the imdeld dataset from IEEEDataPort and copy to the created folder.

How to use the repo:
