@article{AR5,
   abstract = {Under climate change, many species are increasingly exposed to heatwaves, including marine species. Although marine species are expected to succumb to heatwaves, there is increasing interest in understanding why some can persist. As heatwaves can greatly elevate intertidal seawater temperature, we explore reasons for variation in biological performance to acute thermal stress among three species of intertidal gastropods. When thermal refuges were unavailable for adaptive behavior, we show that their biological performance (feeding rate) was either maintained (resistant), recovered from a decline (resilient), or collapsed (sensitive), depending on the strength of molecular defense (where resistant species &gt; resilient species &gt; sensitive species). The integration of molecular, physiological, and behavioral responses within a species illustrates the kind of adaptive capacity that allows organisms to survive heatwaves and maintain their ecological functions. In this era of unprecedented environmental change, understanding how organisms persist seems as important as understanding how organisms perish.},

@generic{EnergySavingStrategiesIndustry,
   abstract = {An industrial sector uses more energy than any other end-use sectors and currently this sector is consuming about 37% of the world's total delivered energy. Energy is consumed in the industrial sector by a diverse group of industries including manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction and for a wide range of activities, such as processing and assembly, space conditioning, and lighting. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review about industrial energy saving by management, technologies and policies. Latest literatures in terms of thesis (MS and PhD), journal articles, conference proceedings, web materials, reports, books, handbooks on industrial energy management, policies and energy savings strategies have been compiled. Energy saving by management including energy audit, training programs and housekeeping beside some energy management practices in the world has been reviewed. Energy saving technologies, such as use of high efficiency motors (HEMs), variable speed drives (VSDs), economizers, leak prevention and reducing pressure drop has been reviewed. Based on energy saving technologies results, it has been found that in the industrial sectors, a sizeable amount of electric energy, emissions and utility bill can be saved using these technologies. Payback periods for different energy savings measures have been identified and found to be economically viable in most cases. Finally, various energy-saving policies for few selected countries were reviewed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{ReducingEnergyDemand,
   abstract = {Most commentators expect improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand to provide the dominant contribution to tackling global climate change. But at the global level, the correlation between increased wealth and increased energy consumption is very strong and the impact of policies to reduce energy demand is both limited and contested. Different academic disciplines approach energy demand reduction in different ways: emphasising some mechanisms and neglecting others, being more or less optimistic about the potential for reducing energy demand and providing insights that are more or less useful for policymakers. This article provides an overview of the main issues and challenges associated with energy demand reduction, summarises how this challenge is 'framed' by key academic disciplines, indicates how these can provide complementary insights for policymakers and argues that a 'sociotechnical' perspective can provide a deeper understanding of the nature of this challenge and the processes through which it can be achieved. The article integrates ideas from the natural sciences, economics, psychology, innovation studies and sociology but does not give equal weight to each. It argues that reducing energy demand will prove more difficult than is commonly assumed and current approaches will be insufficient to deliver the transformation required.},

A consequent issue may be the effectiveness of these predictions, and sources that errors can be traced back to. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has published its annual World Energy Outlook (WEO) concerning energy demand based on its long term world energy model (WEM) under specific assumptions towards uncertainties such as population, macroeconomy, energy price and technology. Unfortunately, some of its predictions succeeded while others failed. We in this paper attempt to decompose the leading source of these errors quantitatively. Results suggest that GDP acts as the leading source of demand forecasting errors while fuel price comes thereafter, which requires extra attention in forecasting. Gas, among all fuel types witness the most biased projections. Ignoring the catch-up effect of acquiring rapid economic growth in developing countries such as China will lead to huge mistake in predicting global energy demand. Finally, asymmetric cost of under- and over-estimation of GDP suggests a potentially less conservative stance in the future.},

The case-study review suggests that energy efficiency investments can provide a significant boost to overall productivity within industry. If this relationship holds, the description of energy-efficient technologies as opportunities for larger productivity improvements has significant implications for conventional economic assessments. The paper explores the implications this change in perspective on the evaluation of energy-efficient technologies for a study of the iron and steel industry in the US. This examination shows that including productivity benefits explicitly in the modeling parameters would double the cost-effective potential for energy efficiency improvement, compared to an analysis excluding those benefits.

Although researchers still continue to question the types of feedback that are most effective in encouraging conservation and peak load reduction, some trends have emerged. These include that feedback be received as quickly as possible to the time of consumption; be related to a standard; be clear and meaningful and where possible both direct and indirect feedback be customised to the customer.

% Background

@article{ISIC,
   abstract = {The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) is the international reference classification of productive activities. Its main purpose is to provide a set of activity categories that can be utilized for the collection and reporting of statistics according to such activities. Since the adoption of the original version of ISIC in 1948, the majority of countries around the world have used ISIC as their national activity classification or have developed national classifications derived from ISIC. ISIC has therefore provided guidance to countries in developing national activity classifications and has become an important tool for comparing statistical data on economic activities at the international level. Wide use has been made of ISIC, both nationally and internationally, in classifying data according to kind of economic activity in the fields of economic and social statistics, such as for statistics on national accounts, demography of enterprises, employment and others. In addition, ISIC is increasingly used for non-statistical purposes. This fourth revision of ISIC (ISIC, Rev.4) is the outcome of a review process that spanned several years and involved contributions from many classifications experts and users around the world. This process resulted in an ISIC structure that is more detailed than the previous version, responding to the need to identify many new industries separately. This is especially applicable in the case of services. Moreover, the relevance of the Classification has been enhanced with the introduction of new high-level categories to better reflect current economic phenomena. A new section entitled “Information and communication” (see part three, sect. J) is one such innovation. Comparability has also been enhanced with a number of other regional activity classifications, thus making this version of ISIC a much improved tool for international data comparison. A number of alternate aggregations have been included in the present publication. They provide analytical tools for areas which, for conceptual reasons, do not lend themselves to aggregation within the existing ISIC structure. Among the alternate aggregations included in this version of ISIC are aggregations for information and communications technology, the informal sector and non-profit institutions, as well as two aggregations for national accounts-type analysis, one at very aggregated and another at an intermediate level of ISIC. The structure of the fourth revision of ISIC was considered and approved by the Statistical Commission at its thirty-seventh session, in March 2006,1 as the internationally accepted standard. It now replaces the third revision of the classification2 and its update, Revision 3.1,3 which have been in use since 1989 and 2002, respectively.},

They can supply information such as type of load, electricity consumption detail and the running conditions of the appliances to both the consumer and the utility. The information can be used to formulate load plan strategies for optimal energy utilization. Load monitoring techniques can generally be grouped into intrusive and non-intrusive load monitoring. Intrusive load monitoring provides accurate results and would allow each individual appliance's energy consumption to be communicated to a central hub. However, this method is costly because of the number of equipment to be manufactured and installed. This has prompted the introduction of non-intrusive load monitoring system. Non-intrusive load monitoring is cost effective and convenient means of load monitoring since it requires lower equipment due to fewer components to install and smaller space requirements.

SCADA systems have made substantial progress over the recent years in terms of functionality, scalability, performance and openness such that they are an alternative to in house development even for very demanding and complex control systems as those of physics experiments.

@inproceedings{AMBAL,
   abstract = {Well annotated power consumption traces are a crucial prerequisite for the development and analysis of load disaggregation algorithms. Due to the high efforts required to collect such traces in the real world, their synthetic generation has emerged as a viable alternative. However, many current models for the synthetic trace generation simply combine statistical information about household occupancy with the energy consumptions of the most frequently performed user activities. While this may suffice for high-level analyses (i.e., considering groups of households or entire cities), such models do not reflect the actual diversity of consumption signatures in real data. We overcome this limitation in this paper by presenting a system design to model appliance power consumption at a user-definable accuracy. Our Automated Model Builder for Appliance Loads (AMBAL) allows to derive models from real device power consumption data collected by means of smart plugs. These models are represented by sequences of parametrized signatures; each model's complexity is kept minimized for its desired level of accuracy. We evaluate the accuracy of AMBAL's models for device traces with consumption patterns of different complexity, taken from existing appliance-level data sets. Moreover, a synthetic appliance trace generator is presented which allows to recombine appliance models in an effort to simulate user activities in homes with a definable complexity. The generated data is valuable for the development of data analysis algorithms (e.g., Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring), and we integrate it with the NILMTK framework to demonstrate that a similar disaggregation performance is achieved for actual and generated traces.},

   abstract = {Energy disaggregation (a.k.a., Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)) has gained much attention recently due to its role in Demand Response (DR) programs and in new applications associated with the smart grid. Given an aggregated load profile (e.g., total energy consumption of a commer- cial building), NILM is intended to decompose (disaggregate) this signal into its categorized load components. This task is in general hard and has several degrees of freedom. While developing effective energy disaggregation methodologies, verifying the proposed algorithms against real-life experimental data is essential. Commercial buildings offer a significant potential in providing ancil- lary services for DR events. Lack of disaggregated energy data from well-instrumented commercial buildings is a major barrier against validating disaggregation algorithms for such buildings. This paper provides a publicly available data-set captured from a typical commercial building so that re- searchers in energy disaggregation can use and verify their energy disaggregation algorithms specific to commercial buildings.},

However, these data sets typically cover less than 10 households due to the financial cost of such deployments, and are not released in a format which allows the data sets to be easily used by energy disaggregation researchers. To this end, the Dataport database was created by Pecan Street Inc, which contains 1 minute circuit-level and building-level electricity data from 722 households. Furthermore, the non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK) was released in 2014, which provides software infrastructure to support energy disaggregation research, such as data set parsers, benchmark disaggregation algorithms and accuracy metrics. This paper describes the release of a subset of the Dataport database in NILMTK format, containing one month of electricity data from 669 households.

Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation aims to estimate appliance level energy consumption from the aggregate consumption data of households. NILM algorithms, proposed hitherto, are either centralized or do require high performance systems to derive appliance level data, owing to the computational complexity associated. This approach raises several issues related to scalability and privacy of consumer's data. In this paper, we present the Location-aware Energy Disaggregation Framework (LocED) that utilizes occupancy of users to derive accurate appliance level usage information. LocED framework limits the appliances considered for disaggregation based on the current location of occupants. Thus, LocED can provide real-time feedback on appliance level energy consumption and run on an embedded system locally at the household. We propose several accuracy metrics to study the performance of LocED. To test the robustness of LocED, we empirically evaluated it across multiple publicly available datasets. LocED has significantly high energy disaggregation accuracy while exponentially reducing the computational complexity. We also release our comprehensive dataset DRED (Dutch Residential Energy Dataset) for public use, which measures electricity, occupancy and ambient parameters of the house- hold.},

To address this, new measurements were performed and combined with data emanating from an earlier study to provide a database of annual measurements for 23 houses at a 1-min resolution that characterizes whole-house, non-HVAC, air conditioner, and furnace fan electrical draws, as well as the draw patterns of some major appliances. All houses were located in Ottawa, Canada. The non-HVAC measurements of this 23-house sample were shown to be in agreement with published estimates for the housing stock. The furnace fan was found to be the most significant end-use.

From this arises a need for a preferably flexible and full-featured user interface to visualize the energy data in the building and allow residents to collect and realize various needs and preferences to the system. This article introduces a generic user interface for building operating systems which is presented from aspects of design, implementation and evaluation. To ensure the user interface can be flexibly adapted to various types of buildings, we design a series of generic data models which are independent of any building operating system. Besides, three roles with different permissions and a number of functional components of the user interface are also introduced in the article. Based on the design, a prototype of such a generic user interface named Building Operating System User Interface (BOS UI) has been implemented to operate the Energy Smart Home Lab (ESHL) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). We evaluate the design, functionality and usability of the BOS UI qualitatively and quantitatively. The evaluation results show that the BOS UI meets a set of desired requirements (except for system configuration) for a generic user interface of building operating systems. Besides this, the evaluation experiments yielded very positive feedback in many aspects including improvement of energy efficiency and user experience. More than 90% of the test users agreed that the BOS UI provided them with enough information and functionalities that they would need in their daily lives and it can help them to save money. Furthermore, the mean score of the System Usability Scale (SUS) is 79.0, which indicates a good usability. The experiments prove that the user interface is still easy to use, despite abundant features are integrated into the system.},

   abstract = {Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) can be split into event detection, classification and energy tracking. Different algorithms have already been proposed for the respective tasks. Each algorithm has been verified based on publicly available data sets to assess its performance. The two types of data sets that currently exist can be distinguished into two types: laboratory measurements and data sets from real world environment. In general, the available laboratory measurements provide data of individual devices; these are only of limited use for overall benchmark tests. Measurements, in which several devices have been active simultaneously, only exist in real scenario datasets. Nevertheless, the assignment of reference data in real scenarios is somehow problematic: issues are, for example, the synchronization between reference data and measured data, absence or excess of events and the number of on and off cycles of each device respectively. Furthermore, the probability distribution of the devices, as well as long measurement cycles with correspondingly large amounts of data, but low number of events, are challenging. Therefore, it is very difficult to compare the current NILM algorithms. Home Equipment Laboratory Dataset (HELD1) has multiple switching on and off events of several devices acting individually and/or simultaneously. Since the individual devices can be controlled separately, the reference data is available in a very high quality. Thus, high number of events can be generated within a short measuring time. In addition, the dataset contains different complex scenarios of various numbers of appliances. The objective of this data set is to offer a better basis to enhance the comparability between the individual NILM approaches.},

Real-time end user energy feedback, using disaggregated electric load composition, can play a pivotal role in motivating consumers towards energy conservation.

However, key questions regarding the reliability and feasibility of using EMI signatures for non-intrusive load monitoring over multiple appliances across different sensing paradigms remain unanswered. This work presents some of the key challenges towards using EMI as a unique and time invariant feature for load disaggregation. In-depth empirical evaluations of a large number of appliances in different sensing configurations are carried out, in both laboratory and real world settings. Insights into the effects of external parameters such as line impedance, background noise and appliance coupling on the EMI behavior of an appliance are realized through simulations and measurements. A generic approach for simulating the EMI behavior of an appliance that can then be used to do a detailed analysis of real world phenomenology is presented. The simulation approach is validated with EMI data from a router. Our EMI dataset - High Frequency EMI Dataset (HFED) is also released. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

The recent emergence of smart energy meters makes it possible to collect such data, which can then be used for analysis. In this paper, we release I-BLEND, 52 months of electrical energy dataset at a one-minute sampling rate from commercial and residential buildings of an academic institute campus in an emerging economy, India. Also, we provide occupancy datasets at a 10-minute sampling rate for each of the campus buildings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such dataset from India. Public availability of such fine-granular data will allow users to perform different research tasks such as analyzing the impact of weather or occupancy schedule on energy consumption, detecting anomalies, and developing algorithms for predictive maintenance.},

Design requirements for such systems include a low hardware and installations costs for residential, reliability and high-availability for industrial purposes, while keeping invasive interventions into the electrical infrastructure to a minimum. This work introduces a reference hardware setup that allows an in depth analysis of electrical energy consumption in industrial environments. To identify appliances and their consumption profile, appropriate identification algorithms are developed by the NILM community. To enable an evaluation of these algorithms on industrial appliances, we introduce the Laboratory-measured IndustriaL Appliance Characteristics (LILAC) dataset: 1302 measurements from one, two, and three concurrently running appliances of 15 appliance types, measured with the introduced testbed. To allow in-depth appliance consumption analysis, measurements were carried out with a sampling rate of 50 kHz and 16-bit amplitude resolution for voltage and current signals. We show in experiments that signal signatures, contained in the measurement data, allows one to distinguish the single measured electrical appliances with a baseline machine learning approach of nearly 100 % accuracy.},

Whilst having similarities with the Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) tasks for residential buildings, the nature of the signals that are collected from large commercial buildings introduces additional difficulties to the NILM research causing existing NILM approaches to fail. On the other hand, the amount of publicly available datasets collected from commercial buildings is very limited, which makes the NILM research even more challenging for this type of large buildings. In this study, we aim at addressing these issues. We first present an extensive statistical analysis of both commercial and residential measurements from public and private datasets and show important differences. Secondly, we develop an algorithm for generating synthetic current data based on a modelization of the current flowing through an electrical device. We then demonstrate that our electrical device model fits well real measurements and that our simulations are realistic by using the quantitative metrics described in the previous section. Finally, to encourage research on commercial buildings we release a synthesized dataset called SHED that can be used to evaluate NILM algorithms.},

These deployments are motivating researchers to develop new energy analytics that mine smart meter data to learn insights into home energy usage and behavior. Unfortunately, a significant barrier to evaluating energy analytics is the overhead of instrumenting homes to collect aggregate energy usage data and data from each device. As a result, researchers typically evaluate their analytics on only a small number of homes, and cannot rigorously vary a home's characteristics to determine what attributes of its energy usage affect accuracy. To address the problem, we develop SmartSim, a publicly-available device-accurate smart home energy trace generator. SmartSim generates energy usage traces for devices by combining a device energy model, which captures its pattern of energy usage when active, with a device usage model, which specifies its frequency, duration, and time of activity. SmartSim then generates aggregate energy data for a simulated home by combining the data from each device. We integrate SmartSim with NILM-TK, a publicly-available toolkit for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), and compare its synthetically generated traces with traces from a real home to show they yield similar quantitative and qualitative results for representative energy analytics.},
